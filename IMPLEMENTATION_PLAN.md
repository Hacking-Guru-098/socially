## Current Development Focus

We are currently in **Phase 2.1: Content Management Enhancement**. The primary focus is on:

1. Completing the content creation interface
2. Implementing media upload functionality
3. Adding editing tools and publishing options

This builds upon the existing profile screen navigation to the analytics, business, and chat screens that are already implemented.

## Development Guidelines

1. **Prioritize functionality over advanced navigation**
   - Focus on implementing core features first
   - Use simplified navigation until core features are complete
   - Add advanced navigation once features are stable

2. **Test across platforms**
   - Test on both native platforms and web
   - Address platform-specific issues separately
   - Ensure backward compatibility

3. **Follow the PRD specifications**
   - Refer to the detailed UI/UX specifications
   - Implement components as defined
   - Adhere to the design system
